		<h1>Happy Birthday Kevin!</h1>
		<img src= "fusion-founder.jpg" width="250" height="320">
			<p>I was trying to think what to get you for your birthday, and so this is it! <br> 
			 I have paid up on the domain name and server fees for the next year! And in that time
			I'm going to build a website for fusionblends with your input of course.</p>
			<p>I am so proud of how far you have come and how far I still know you will go! You make me a better version of myself, Kevin. And if you believe in FusionBlends<sup>Â©</sup>-- I believe in you. </p>
			<p>
<p><br>"Let everyone else call your idea crazy...just keep going.<br>Don't stop. Don't even think about stopping until you're there,<br>and don't give much thought to where 'there' is."</p>
<p>Con amor siempre,</p>
<p>Emily</p>
