			<p style="font-family:courier;">I was trying to think what to get you for your birthday, and so this is it! <br> 
			 I have paid up on the domain name and server fees for the next year! And in that time
			I'm going to build a website for fusionblends with your input of course.</p>
			<p style="font-family:courier;">I am so proud of how far you have come and how far I still know you will go! You make me a better version of myself, Kevin. And if you believe in FusionBlends<sup>Â©</sup>-- I believe in you. </p>
			<p style="font-family:courier;"><br>"Let everyone else call your idea crazy...just keep going.<br>Don't stop. Don't even think about stopping until you're there,<br>and don't give much thought to where 'there' is."</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">Con amor siempre,</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">Emily</p>
